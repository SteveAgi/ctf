Hey! [I'm Dennis](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/about.html), the person behind Hopper's Roppers. 

This is the Roppers Academy Capture the Flag course. It is the second course in the [roadmap](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/roadmap/) I use to guide students towards the best resources available, instead of overloading them with options and a list of websites. I strongly believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and nothing gets you doing faster than participating in Capture the Flag competitions. Your ability will be stretched, your motivation will be tested, and most importantly, you will be forced to learn new things in short periods of time. The single best predictor of success in just about anything is an individual's ability to look at a problem and determine how to solve it by themselves using the knowledge and resources available to them. CTFs teach that skill in a way nothing else can. 

This course will teach you everything you need to jump into a beginner CTF and crush File Forensics, Cryptography, scripting problems and more. I will point you towards the best references and the best resources to learn by yourself going forward, along with always being available to answer your questions and help out in events.

## Certificate

Students who complete this course will receive a badge indicating that they can handle themselves in a CTF and can handle most types of challenges.

## Pre-Requisites
This course is absurdly fast paced and immediately will take anyone out of their comfort zone. The only knowledge required for success in this course is a decent understanding of Linux. Some knowledge of scripting is useful, but if you don't know how to yet you'll just waste some time until you get around to learning it. If you still need to learn the fundamentals, check out our awesome [Introduction to Computing Fundamentals](hoppersroppers.org/course.html). If you are looking for a course with a focus on cyber security, check out our [Introduction to Security Fundamentals](hoppersroppers.org/courseSecurity.html). If you are ready for the fun stuff, keep on with this course.

This course is the deep end and it is guaranteed that a student graduating from a 4 year computer science or cyber security degree will have <b> no idea </b> what is going on with most of these questions. I can also guarantee that someone who is brand new to the field and has finished the Computing Fundamentals course will be able to figure out what they need to do. This is very much intentional.

You are about to learn more in this class than you previously have in entire years. Trust the process, stick around, and get ready to redefine what you are capable of.
