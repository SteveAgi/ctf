There are a wide variety of skills required to succeed in a CTF
competition.

This course will attempt to teach you everything you need to know to
start and take on any competition.

First, we will start with encoding and data representation, then we will
launch into CTF specific topics.

Cryptography will be brief and will go over basic problems and how to
solve them. Forensics is comprised of host-based and network forensics
and we will go into the basics of that. Â We will also go into the basics
of web exploitation and how some of those challenges work.

This is a beginner course, so we will not be getting into Reverse
Engineering or Binary Exploitation at all. This is meant to prepare you
for the picoCTF competition where you will have to figure out how to use
the skills and resources you learned in this course to solve problems as
you go.
