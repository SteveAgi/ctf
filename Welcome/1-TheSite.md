# Hopper's Roppers

This site was originally created to help train new members of my CTF
team. Once I got the curriculum to where I wanted it to be I shared it
with the world. My goal is for this site to become the best place on the
internet for a beginner to take their first steps into the field. I
already think that it is, but my goal is for this to become the place
that everyone is confident recommending as their go-to.

The site is named after Grace Hopper because she is my favorite person
in computing history. You might have heard of her before, but if not, <a
