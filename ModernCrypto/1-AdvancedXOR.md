# Advanced XOR

25% of the time you see an XOR challenge in a CTF, you will have been
given multiple XORd messages. Based off of how XOR works, you can XOR
them against eachother and do something called a crib drag. I recommend
<a href="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/cribdrag" target="_blank">this
repo</a> for crib dragging, but there are also online solvers.

Do this crib drag problem. <a

The other 74.99% of the time you see an XOR problem in a CTF, you can
solve it with something named xortool. There are also websites online
that do the same thing, but will fail on larger texts.

Complete one of these two writeups:

If it doesn't get solved with xortool, you're probably just doing it
wrong, because the magic math should work. Also, resist the urge to
bruteforce with xortool... if that happens, you're also probably doing
it wrong.

Submit a sentence or two on what you had to do to solve these challenges
and anything you struggled with understanding.
