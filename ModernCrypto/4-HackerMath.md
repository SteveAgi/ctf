# Hacker Math

This is mostly fun... not too important, but it's fun to make your brain
work hard. 

We don't need to know crazy math to be good hackers, as we saw with the
crypto section, we can lean on other people's existing programs to get
us where we need to go.

However, there are a few "mathy" ideas that are good to know outside of
crypto.

# Conditional Probability and Monty Hall

This is often in CTF challenges and is really hard to wrap your head
around. The first time I found it my friends and I basically stopped
working for 3 hours and yelled that wasn't how the real world works. 

  

Alas, it does.

You don't need to memorize any of these, but it is good to know what
they are so you can spot them.

For your assignment, explain Monty Hall in your own words.
