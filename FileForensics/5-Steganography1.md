# Steganography 1

Steganography, or stego, challenges are among the most hated of all CTF
challenges because they really are only limited in difficulty by how
much of a pain in the ass the people who wrote the challenge are. No
matter the challenge, if you've come across a picture that doesn't have
anything useful in it or in the metadata and have spent far too long
trying to figure out what it means, it is worthwhile to throw it into a
few stego solvers you will download below. If it works, curse the person
who made the challenge and continue working. If it doesn't work, you've
exhausted one avenue and it's time to keep looking for something else.

If you follow this [Stego
Checklist](https://stegonline.georgeom.net/checklist) you rarely can go
wrong, and luckily, there are a few "standard" problems and tools that
make solving those problems easier.

Steghide is the defacto tool for password protected stego challenges,
but don't forget to try steghide with no password.

With these two tools you should be able to solve 90% of all stego
problems. Even if these don't work, they can still identify weirdness
and you can investigate further.

Submit a sentence or two on what you had to do to solve this challenge
and anything you struggled with understanding.
