It goes a bit advanced into what filesystem forensics looks like rather
than just file forensics, but it's good to get that perspective. I don't
recommend you try to do this writeup, reading should be enough to expand
your brain. 

If you are new to the Roppers learning mindset, understanding isn't
particularly important, I'm much more focused on you contextualizing
things to start off. 

For this assignment, submit what the most interesting part of this
challenge was for you.
