### Data and You

Humans talk to humans. Humans talk to computers. Humans talk to humans
through computers. Computers talk to humans. Computers talk to
computers. Each of those use cases can look very very different, because
the considerations for how each party to that conversations wants to
pass data can be very different. Security of that data, along with
confirming the integrity of it, is basically the core of communication,
going back as far as possible. 

Previously humans were limited by the noises we could make with our
bodies, the hand signals we could make, or even the letters we could
write. Unfortunately, computers had to come and ruin everything by
making infinite languages, and all the different ways we can convey
information is impossible to get a grasp on, for the rest of time. This
makes funky (and not so funky) ways to represent information a core part
of nearly all CTF challenges. 

But fear not, we can at least try to learn the important ways we pass
information around these days and go from there... And hopefully we can
still appreciate the benefits that computers have provided us in regards
to communication, in addition to how much harder they have made CTF
challenges. Every single CTF challenge is an encoding problem at its
core. 

  

### Encoding vs Encryption vs Hashing vs Obfuscation

This is an important read to get the basic ideas of how we modify
information, and how it relates to security.
