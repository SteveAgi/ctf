# Your First XOR

Read this: <a href="https://ctf101.org/cryptography/what-is-xor/"

Then play around with <https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef>. Notice that
doubling up the XOR shows plaintext... 

Decode these: 

1\. o8qLh8qyj4SLyrKluLijpbjKmpiDhImPmZk=, with key "xena"

As a hint for \#1, the ciphertext is base64 encoded, which is often
indicated by the = sign at the end.

2\. 54 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 61 20 6c 69 74 74 6c 65 20 62 69 74 20 68 61
72 64 65 72 2c 20 62 75 74 20 79 6f 75 20 67 6f 74 20 69 74 2e

3\.
C\*}cff\*ho\*\|oxs\*ydokas\*\~bcy\*\~cgo&\*h.\~\*C\*\~bcda\*se.-ff\*mo\~\*c\~$

I'm not giving you the key to \#2... which means it is easily
bruteforceable. There are plenty of sites that will help you bruteforce
this outside of just Cyberchef.

For 3, I will give the crib that the word "sneaky" is in the text... I
think it should help.
