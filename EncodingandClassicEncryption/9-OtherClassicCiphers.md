# Other Classic Ciphers

I recommend when you see a ciphertext and you don't have the cipher
name, run through a list of
these <http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/classical-era/> and see
if any jump out at you. It's an imperfect art, but it is an art.

So this should be a bit of fun... use the skills you have now to work
through a few different challenges... some I will tell you the cipher,
others you'll have to fight through.

1.  Frankly, I don't like pigs
    1.  10000 01101 01010 01010 00110 01101 00000 10010 10001
2.  It's an enigma to me...
    1.  Configuration: 
        1.  '3-rotor',  
            'EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ\<R','A','A','AJDKSIRUXBLHWTMCQGZNPYFVOE\<F','A','A','BDFHJLCPRTXVZNYEIWGAKMUSQO\<W','A','A','AY
            BR CU DH EQ FS GL IP JX KN MO TZ VW','',true)
        2.  Wiring: (If Required): 'LEYJVCNIXWPBQMDRTAKZGFUHOS'
    2.  Item to Decode: 
        1.  IZHXB AQPJJ THIZT IWTRS LQGVR DYOCY ALEUY HDUHX HUWMR TNBGT
            SXQIV X
        2.  This decrypts to a URL with all special characters
            removed... figure out which URL this points to and submit it
            as the flag.
3.  A fine day...

There are some good lessons to be learned about when to go bruteforce,
when to figure it out manually... and also to look for hints ;)
