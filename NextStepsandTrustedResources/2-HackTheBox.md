# HackTheBox
Even more advanced than TryHackMe is [HacktheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), which is an even better platform filled with challenges, training, and very addictively, individual boxes for you to hack. 

This stuff is for learning security, and very explicitly, how to hack, which is a hell of a lot of fun. I'm not pretending to teach pentest stuff on this site, all that you should learn from other people. 

Just like how you learned on Roppers, watch walkthroughs, take notes, and always keep improving your skills.
