[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is an incredible resource that gets you great resources to learn just about any subject. Make an account and hack on different challenges, you might just find yourself addicted. 

I am a huge fan of their paths, which offer some pretty great stuff that start to go into more formal security training. Right now, you are prepared to absolutely CRUSH their beginner curriculum, which I believe is top of the line. Why did I want you to do Roppers before you do their beginner curriculum? Well, mostly because beginner curriculum's are very rarely meant for beginners, and theirs is no exception. On the plus side, it's a great for first steps in security now that you've nailed down computing fundamentals.

So jealous of those guys... someday, maybe Roppers will be like them. 






Nahhhh.
