This is a rough draft of a course. Nothing is complete, but it will get you pointed in the correct direction. 

It focuses on basic networking principles and teaching how to work with and understand packet captures.

I recommend you look through the rest of this course before heading off and focusing on networking, but don't let me stop you.
