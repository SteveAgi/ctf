{"./":{"url":"./","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction Hopper's Roppers is a website dedicated to providing the best training possible for students who are new to the field. One of the ways that we do this is through a series of free courses. This is the text based version of our Introduction to Capture the Flags Course. We believe competition is the best way to build motivation and skills in our students, so we built a course to teach CTF basics, how to use essential tools, and common problem types to prepare our students to compete by themselves. Our goal is to teach the fundamentals so that when faced with challenges, in competition or the real world, our students understand the problem, know the resources they have available, and are able to solve it themselves. This site is generated from a Moodle course hosted at: https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=7 All the material is available here, but in order to get the full benefits of our course we recommend registering so that we can track your progress, grade your submissions, and provide feedback and support when you need it. If you have any questions, hit us on Twitter @hoppersroppers. If you have recommended changes or feedback, this is all available on GitHub for anyone to submit issues or pull requests.

When you sign up for this site, you automatically become a member of our not-at-all competitive team, which also happens to be named Hopper's Roppers. This whole site is grown out of the training I made for my college security team who competed in various cyber security competitions. Now, Hopper's Roppers is a distributed team, open to anyone, but is especially meant to be a place for beginners to learn the ropes in and we will participate in any event we have the numbers for. You will not be ready to compete while you are still working your way through this course... the good news, is you don't need to be ready to compete to do it. All you have to do is sign up, know your brain is going to hurt and you probably won't understand anything, and be ready to learn. There is no better measure of ability, grit, and the hacker mentality than playing in a competition. Every CTF requires you to use what you already know to identify what you will need to learn on the spot to solve the problem. As you are now a member of our team, we will let you know when competitions are occurring and we hope to see you there if you have the time. Even if you are new and don't think you have anything to contribute, you will learn more picking someone's brain as you shoulder-surf them (or watch them on Twitch) than you possibly could trying to learn by yourself.

There are a wide variety of skills required to succeed in a CTF competition. This course will attempt to teach you everything you need to know to start and take on any competition. First, we will start with how to use linux and linux command line tools. Then after a brief introduction to python scripting, we will launch into CTF specific topics. Forensics is comprised of host-based and network forensics and we will go into the basics of that. Cryptography will be brief and will go over basic problems and how to solve them. We will also go into the basics of web exploitation and how some of those challenges work. This is a beginner course, so we will not be getting into Reverse Engineering or Binary Exploitation at all. This is meant to prepare you for the picoCTF competition where you will have to figure out how to use the skills and resources you learned in this course to solve problems as you go.

Flag Format Most of the time the flag format will be an ASCII string that you discover during the course of the problem. In the most common scenario it will look something like \"The Flag is: this_is_the_flag\", \"ctfName{this_is_the_flag}\"\" or just \"this_is_the_flag\". Sometimes the organizers will use leetspeak so it will look like \"ctfName{th15_15_th3_fl4g}\"\". Of course not all flags can follow these formats, so always be looking for anything out of place, especially during forensics challenges. Most problems will specify the flag format, but if they do not, you must be on the lookout for any ambiguity. Always check for: Capitalization Character encoding Trailing whitespace/newlines Date/Time formats Hex address formats (0x0042 vs 0042 vs 00000042) Sometimes the flag will require you to submit a hash of a variety of information that you have found. Be especially careful with these problems to verify what you are putting into your hashing algorithm, and that you are using the right algo. Very rarely is a flag able to be brute forced. As a result, even if the potential number of solutions is small, expect that there is a twist or mis-spelling that will require you to solve the problem. Most CTFs will specifically have a rule against brute forcing in their rules because of the potential impact on the event infrastructure, so just solve the problem, don't bruteforce. Mechanics Some common mechanics for Jeopardy-style CTFs: Just like Jeopardy, the more difficult problems are worth more points, and the easier or higher-variance trivia and guessing problems worth fewer points. This encourages people to look at the difficult problems and learn the more hardcore security skills! Therefore, any CTF scoring system--however complex--must strongly tend to reward the teams that demonstrate the best security skills. Think hard on your game mechanics, and try to keep them from being exploitable or distracting too much from the core challenges. (Not that that can't be fun, but little in this document would apply to such a competition!) Some common mechanics for Jeopardy-style CTFs: Often solving the easier challenges will unlock harder, higher point challenges. Binary Exploitation problems wind up having some of the highest general point values because they are the most difficult skills to learn. There are usually extra \"first blood\" points (usually only a small number that allow for tie-breaking) given to the first few teams who solve a challenge. This discourages \"flag hoarding\", where a team holds on to their flags and submits them all at the very end of the competition. (This is a fairly advanced move, but flag hoarding allows a team to hide their true score on the scoreboard, causing other teams to feel that they have comfortable leads and don't need to be working to the last minutes. Then the flag hoarders can drop their stored flags and pull ahead in the last few seconds. Awesome when you do it, pretty terrible when it is done to you.). Communication Organizers are usually reachable throughout the entire CTF, either in an IRC, Slack, or by email. With that said, you should never reach out to organizers for hints during the competition. However, if a challenge appears to be failing or a webserver is not responding, you should let them know so that they can take action behind the scenes to make sure everything is operating as designed. Organizers also usually have an official, non-real time channel like a Twitter or a news page on the site to ensure that nobody misses any important game updates. Sometimes hints are dropped their too. Whenever a change is made to a problem, usually it is announced in whatever the non-real time channel is, in addition to in the real time chat. When this happens, make sure to check the problem description for a change, and if a file has been updated, your first move should be diffing the two files to find what was \"fixed\". Most of the time that will help you find your answer. References: http://captf.com/maxims.html https://github.com/pwning/docs/blob/master/suggestions-for-running-a-ctf.markdown Visit the course page!

Host forensics is the most hated of all CTF problem types. This is not because the problems are particularly hard or boring, but is because some people who make the problems are lazy and make it into a dumb guessing game. Personally, forensics problems are my favorite category. It's the one that has the most applicability to real world jobs, is super easy to get started, and when the problems are done correctly, it is basically like solving a mystery. There are a few categories of forensic problems that we will go over in this course, focusing on the ones that we see in CTF problems the most frequently. None of this should be confused with what actual forensic analysts do in an incident response, however, many of the skills overlap and there are some fundamental theories that can be applied to CTF problems.

Cryptography is often considered to be one of the harder challenge types because many of the problems require deep specialization to understand. However, we are not teaching deep specialization in this course, we are teaching quick and dirty techniques to solve problems and find resources. There are a variety of common crypto problems such as: Ciphertext only Ciphertext + private key and algorithm Ciphertext and custom source code Ciphertext + public key and algorithm For the most part, you will always get enough ciphertext for meaningful statistics and for any advanced cryptography problem they will let you know what the algorithm is because the ciphertext will all be totally random. The only time you will get ciphertext only is for very short, classical algorithms. It is also unlikely that any problem is going to require extensive password cracking or bruteforcing.

Remember what we said earlier about how math will win, every time? The corollary to the rule that you cannot beat math is \"Never roll your own crypto\". https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wnx8nq/why-you-dont-roll-your-own-crypto. Anybody can write their own crypto libraries, but it probably sucks and is susceptible to attacks that were known in 1942. So when you see a CTF challenge with a \"custom encryption library\", know that whoever wrote that library implemented it wrong. In order to solve that challenge, you will need to know a great deal more about crypto than this course will try to teach you. If you want to become very very good at crypto, do the Matasano CryptoPals challenges. https://cryptopals.com/ and spend the rest of your days reading academic papers. Otherwise, just move on with your life. So moving on, if implemented properly (and the assumption for all standard libraries is that they are), the attacker will not beat math. It doesn't matter if you spin up a cloud server or build a facility in Utah, you're not going to beat math. Anytime you find yourself trying to do any of these things, assume that you have gone wrong somewhere along the way. Reverse a hash If nothing comes up when you google for it, move on.

They scoop up everything that is publicly available and index it, allowing you to search it. However... what happens when the web crawlers find something that they shouldn't? Play around with a few of these Google hacks on Exploit-DB: https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database Don't break any laws while doing it, but it is a lot of fun seeing what is available online. In order to prevent Google and other search engines from indexing a site, many sites use a robots.txt file to \"block\" the web crawlers. Robots.txt files are not actually part of an RFC yet, despite being an accepted part of the internet for years, but Google has recently proposed the Robots Exclusion Protocol as an official standard under Internet Engineering Task Force . Importantly, robots.txt are meant to be a good faith request by site administrators, and are regularly ignored by web crawlers. This means that any web crawler, or you, can visit a site's robots.txt and quickly identify any part of the site that the owner does not want crawled. This often comes up in CTF problems, so it is always worth a quick check. Visit the course page!

In a controversial move, I don't believe this is a beginner topic! I think it is a major shortcoming of the community that we pretend this is something beginners should be able to figure out by themselves. Before even attempting a reversing or exploitation problem a student should have a full understanding of C and assembly. It is very possible to fake it, and write buffer overflow exploits without knowing what a jmp instruction is (I certainly did), but we do a disservice to students by acting like this stuff is on the same level as the other materials taught in this course. If you are angry at me for saying this, or have a better idea, let me know! Email me at d.m.devey@gmail.com or in Slack. When I get around to writing an Advanced CTFs course I will have plenty of Reversing and BinEx... and a knowledge of C and Assembly will be non-negotiable pre-requisites. Visit the course page!
