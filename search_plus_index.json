One of the ways that we do this is through a series of free courses. This is the text based version of our Introduction to Capture the Flags Course. We believe competition is the best way to build motivation and skills in our students, so we built a course to teach CTF basics, how to use essential tools, and common problem types to prepare our students to compete by themselves. Our goal is to teach the fundamentals so that when faced with challenges, in competition or the real world, our students understand the problem, know the resources they have available, and are able to solve it themselves.

This course will attempt to teach you everything you need to know to start and take on any competition. First, we will start with encoding and data representation, then we will launch into CTF specific topics. Cryptography will be brief and will go over basic problems and how to solve them. Forensics is comprised of host-based and network forensics and we will go into the basics of that. We will also go into the basics of web exploitation and how some of those challenges work. This is a beginner course, so we will not be getting into Reverse Engineering or Binary Exploitation at all. This is meant to prepare you for the picoCTF competition where you will have to figure out how to use the skills and resources you learned in this course to solve problems as you go.

Once the competition ends, a bunch of people will write up how they solved challenges and then post them on the internet for everyone else. This means that people who didn't solve the challenge can follow along and get most of the benefits of working through it, while leaning on the hardwork that some kind CTFer has put in for them. The secret to being good at CTF is staying on top of writeups and constantly working through ones that other people have released in your area of specialization. Back in college I tried to do every single Network Forensics writeup that was released and kept them very well organized... I wound up being very good at Netforensics challenges after that. As a note, I did not write most of the writeups in this course, I went and found high quality documents scattered around the internet and organized them into a good structure. Those internet heroes who wrote the writeups (as well as the volunteers who wrote the challenges) are the reason this course is possible, because I still haven't found the time to make unique challenges for all of these topics.

Humans talk to computers. Humans talk to humans through computers. Computers talk to humans. Computers talk to computers. Each of those use cases can look very very different, because the considerations for how each party to that conversations wants to pass data can be very different. Security of that data, along with confirming the integrity of it, is basically the core of communication, going back as far as possible. Previously humans were limited by the noises we could make with our bodies, the hand signals we could make, or even the letters we could write. Unfortunately, computers had to come and ruin everything by making infinite languages, and all the different ways we can convey information is impossible to get a grasp on, for the rest of time. This makes funky (and not so funky) ways to represent information a core part of nearly all CTF challenges. But fear not, we can at least try to learn the important ways we pass information around these days and go from there... And hopefully we can still appreciate the benefits that computers have provided us in regards to communication, in addition to how much harder they have made CTF challenges.

Not just do you need to figure out which type of encryption is being used, you also need the secrets required to decrypt. Cryptography is often considered to be one of the harder challenge types because many of the problems require deep specialization to understand. However, we are not teaching deep specialization in this course, we are teaching quick and dirty techniques to solve problems and find resources. There are a variety of common crypto problems such as: Ciphertext only Ciphertext + private key and algorithm Ciphertext and custom source code Ciphertext + public key and algorithm For the most part, you will always get enough ciphertext for meaningful statistics and for any advanced cryptography problem challenge makers will let you know what the algorithm is because the ciphertext will all be totally random. The only time you will get ciphertext only is for very short, classical algorithms. It is also unlikely that any problem is going to require extensive password cracking or bruteforcing.

In the course of an incident response, a critical first step is to capture a copy of the computer that was hacked so that defenders can go over the filesystem to look for badness. In this course, I am going to skip over the filesystem bit at first and go straight to looking at individual files, mostly because learning what to do with funky files is a core competency of all security experts, and many CTF challenges turn into file forensics problems once you get past the first layer. To be up front, forensics is the most hated of all CTF problem types. This is not because the problems are particularly hard or boring, but is because some people who make the problems are lazy and make it into a dumb guessing game. I mentioned earlier that CTF challenges can be guessy and annoying, mostly based on how well the challenge was written... and these are the easiest challenges to make... sooo.... Personally, forensics problems are my favorite category. It's the one that has the most applicability to real world jobs, is super easy to get started, and when the problems are done correctly, it is basically like solving a mystery. There are a few categories of forensic problems that we will go over in this course, focusing on the ones that we see in CTF problems the most frequently. None of this should be confused with what actual forensic analysts do in an incident response, however, many of the skills overlap and there are some fundamental theories that can be applied to CTF problems.

All things considered, you can avoid binary and worrying about CPU stuff most of the time, so let's not focus on them too hard or be too freaked out it is really complicated. If your job is going to require that, you can get good at it.. otherwise... move on. You've gotten a taste of binary, let's talk about non-binary representation. 1s and 0s really are hard to read, so luckily we have something a bit more 68756d616e207265616461626c65... sorry, human readable. Hexadecimal, base 16, hex, whatever you want to call it, will become a language that you see constantly during your technical journey. Being comfortable working with hex is one of the skills that will help you stand out. From the same site as the binary tutorial (gee, sure hope you liked it) we have an introduction to hexadecimal. https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hexadecimal Now, back to the terminal. $ echo \"Hello!\" > file4 $ xxd file4 xxd is able to convert a file into its hexadecimal representation. If you do not have it installed, install it with apt-get. Download this image using wget or curl: a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoppersroppers/hoppersroppers.github.io/main/_layouts/compass.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoppersroppers/hoppersroppers.github.io/main/_layouts/compass.png Open the file with xxd and check out what is in it. Shouldn't make much sense, but it should at least look cool. File formats (and networking protocols, and all sorts of other things on the internet) are defined in documents known as RFCs. All files follow the rules for their file format. Read through the .png format RFC and find where the file signature, aka the \"magic number\" is defined. Don't even think about reading the whole specification, just look for what you need and move on! https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2083 Nobody has this content memorized, but when they deep dive into a format or protocol, the RFC has the answers. You'll spend plenty of time looking through RFCs, but not right now. It makes your brain hurt. Any time you need to deal with a file format, google/wikipedia will provide most of the answers. If you need to dig deeper than that, go to the RFC. Hex-editing xxd is not really a hex-editor, it just displays hex. However, we can use it to convert files into hex, make edits to them with our favorite text editors, then convert the files back into the correct formats. First, let's make a copy of the .png you downloaded using cp and name it \"copyOfPng.png\" We can then use xxd to convert the file into a hexdump. $ xxd copyOfPng.png > hexDumped Now if we open hexDumped with our text editor of choice we can see that it is in a new format. Make an edit to the file and change the first four characters (the magic numbers) to be 0000. Save your changes and go back to the terminal. Now we will use xxd to rebuild the file from hex. $ xxd -r hexDumped > modified.png Try to open modified.png. It shouldn't be opening now because we mangled (that's a technical term for corrupted) the file header! diff One useful tool to find the difference between files is to use diff. diff takes two pieces of text and compares them, looking for differences. With text files usage is as simple as $ diff file1.txt file2.txt and the results will display. It is slightly more complicated with binary files or other dense formats like images. To see what the difference between the original image and the new mangled file we were playing with before: $ diff -y Little bit of fancy footwork going on with redirectors here!!!! We are converting the images to hex with xxd, then redirecting them, then using them as arguments for the diff command. This will display the differences between the two files. diff is great, you will use it all the time. There are GUI versions of diff, but I also really like using online ones in browsers. Saves some time when you need it, and usually very good. I recommend https://www.diffchecker.com/. To fix this mangled file header, we will use a hex-editor. Hex-editors do a similar thing to xxd, but also give us the ability to edit in a nice GUI. The one we will use is bless. It is not particularly fancy but it gets the job done. To install: $ sudo apt-get install bless To open up the mangled file, run $ bless modified.png. Now, using the RFC, correct the mangled bits on the front so that you are able to open the image again. Base64 Base64 is another encoding scheme that uses, you guessed it, 64 characters to represent data in an ASCII text format. Base64 is commonly used to encode binaries that would not be able to be sent via methods that only use ASCII, such as in HTML, in URLs, or in some email formats. Base64 is visually distinctive because of its use of \"=\" at the end of a string of letters and numbers. Most of the time when you see that form, it will be Base64, simply based off of how common Base64 is. Don't worry too much about why there is an \"=\" sign, it is for padding to make translation easier. To manipulate Base64 in the terminal, we use the command base64. $ echo \"Hello World\" | base64 $ echo \"Hello World\" > 64dText $ base64 --decode 64dText $ base64 --decode SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ= It isn't often that you have to do this from the command line, but it happens occasionally. For this assignment, I am going to have you convert between encodings by hand. This is meant to ensure you understand what is going on. Don't cheat, and don't move on until you get it, this is very important you understand. Assignment: Alright. Now. Convert 17 in Ascii to Binary and Hex. Do it by hand. Convert \"Go Navy\" to Octal, Hex, and Binary. Yes. By hand. Use Google to figure out how. This is supposed to not be fun. What does \"c2l4dHlmb3Vy\" translate to from Base64? It is annoying to do that by hand, but it does help in the long run. ... but here is a tool so that you never have to do that again as my apology for making you do it. https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/. Fun fact, it is released by GCHQ, Britain's version of the NSA. Great tool and very useful for converting encodings/encryption, but there is so much more. There are about a thousand uses for this thing and many security professionals use it all the time. I love it for CTFs.

If you just want to move forward (for now), try this example problem. A common scripting problem is connecting to web socket/SSH server and then doing some scripted activity. One critical tip to this is to spend some serious time trying to figure out everything the server does/time outs/etc. Plenty of times you can just get good at whatever task needs to be scripted, or copy/paste it into a different tool then back in, so you can avoid scripting altogether. Butttt, if the lazy ways don't work, it's time for some scripting. You should implement these problems using Pwntools rather than trying to make your own with Python sockets or gasp, something in C. https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools For this section, write a script using pwntools that connects to a port, waits for the word \"Username:\", enters \"root\", waits for \"Password:\", enters \"root\", then takes in 2 numbers, adds them together, and returns the solution. I'm not giving you the \"server\" for this challenge, so you're going to have to write your own server to test this. Write up a server that only accepts root/root as the user/pass and then gives two random numbers and checks that the response is correct. Learning how to write both sides of this is pretty important. To host the server locally for testing, run '''socat TCP-LISTEN:1337,fork EXEC:'/path/to/script',stderr,pty,echo=0'''. Submit your script.

Sometimes it will be old programming languages, like FORTRAN or ADA. If you see a language that you don't recognize, look for something that appears to be the main function or a loop, basically any construct you recognize, and google it. If it is an important piece of the language, someone has mentioned it before and you'll at least know the language name. From there, you have to find some old documentation (or hopefully example code on Github) to copy. You'll have to find a compiler on Github to test them, and getting the entire toolchain to work is a real pain. These challenges are crazy hard, but it feels awesome when you get a punchcard program to compile. Another classic is esoteric programming languages, which are defined by Wikipedia as \" designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke.\" As most things are Turing Complete if you try hard enough (look it up if you don't know what that means, basically anything can be a programming language. Good for challenge developers, bad for you. For the most part though, they'll be using a well-known esoteric like brainfuck, or any of the other languages listed on this wiki page. Writing your own esoteric for a CTF is a lunatic move, so if you see something that doesn't match any of these formats, expect it to be a substitution version of an existing language, so look for syntactical similarities and throw it into an existing interpreter once you've translated it over. Another really common challenge is using an alphabet from another language, especially fictional and scifi ones. For those, use a site named omniglot to get a comprehensive list with examples. As a fun note, you don't actually need to know the language to solve problems like this. As long as it is a standard 26 character alphabet, you can solve any made up language like a substitution cipher using standard cryptographic tools, just map each made up character to a real character and treat it like a substitution. This is all to test your out of the box thinking and ability to learn quickly. It's terrible but they are actually kind of fun.

Since the dawn of shared computing, situations have existed where you want to give a user access to a server, but restrict their ability to run certain commands or read certain files, or sometimes do things like run commands with specific characters or words. I think that restricted shells and privilege escalating out of the them is the purest form of CTF challenge. For these challenge you'll be given a username and pass to a service and then have to find your way out. 95% of the time, something in a href=\"https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/44592-linux-restricted-shell-bypass-guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"this guide to escapes will tell you what you need to do. Read the whole guide and try to understand what the different things mean. If you don't understand why a specific bypass works, do some research. Something that helps when you're working on these problems is once you figure out which type of restricted shell you are in, go and find the original source code on Github and try to determine what modifications the challenge author made to the problem. Once you've found what makes the challenge unique, you've probably found the vulnerable section. If you're stuck with one of these problems and can't figure it out, it's probably ENV variables.

While playing around, check out these basic tips for finding weirdness. Dummy Stuff Find all login pages Many bugs, however complicated their root cause might be, display themselves as a normal user having powers that were meant only for admin Generally, anything that \"admin\" is the only group allowed to do that \"user\" has access to is considered bad. Test everything, attack admin functionality as a normally priv'd user. If you see the word admin, you're probably on the right track. Also, always try admin:admin on everything you touch. As a near general rule, you will not bruteforce logins during CTFs, so don't do it without permission from organizers. If you are bruteforcing, you are likely wrong. Find all upload/content send mechanisms View source of pages Check out cookies (base 64/ plaintext) The most common way sessions are maintained is with cookies. Always check the cookies on a web page, either with a cookie editing tool or using browser DevTools Cookies can be (Will be) encoded so don't be discouraged if they are random alphanumerics, always make sure to check Base64 and other common encodings. Look at URLs If the URL looks like it has a number at the end, try incrementing the number. If the URL has your username at the end, change the username. Look for Robots.txt Attack login pages try baby SQL inject on each one try baby command inject on each one Attack input pages try baby command inject on each one run an XSS scan Recon Nmap -A Services on weird ports are common Dirbust for 2 minutes if nothing against it. Admin panels might pop up Vuln scan with Nikto. If you have a real commercial one, hit it, but you probably won't find anything. CTF challenges aren't supposed to be solved by a scanner.
