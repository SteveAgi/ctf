<$@COURSEVIEWBYID*4@$>

This is a rough draft of a course. Nothing is complete, but it will get you pointed in the correct direction. 

We work through a few of the problems in the h0mbre [C course](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C) , taking time to disassemble, debug, graphically display, and RE various functions. We also work through some of GuyInATuxedo's [Nightmare Exploitation Course](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare/). 

During this course we start with exceptionally simple problems and gradually increase complexity, raising your level of comfort with x86. You won't be an expert, but you'll know what you're doing.
