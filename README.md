# Introduction

Hopper's Roppers is a website dedicated to providing the best training possible for students who are new to the field. One of the ways that we do this is through a series of free courses.

This is the text based version of our Introduction to Capture the Flags Course.

We believe competition is the best way to build motivation and skills in our students, so we built a course to teach CTF basics, how to use essential tools, and common problem types to prepare our students to compete by themselves. Our goal is to teach the fundamentals so that when faced with challenges, in competition or the real world, our students understand the problem, know the resources they have available, and are able to solve it themselves.

This site is generated from a course hosted at:

All the material is available here, but in order to get the full benefits of our course we recommend registering so that we can track your progress, grade your submissions, and provide feedback and support when you need it.

If you have any questions, hit us on Twitter @roppersacademy.

If you have recommended changes or feedback, this is all available on GitHub for anyone to submit issues or pull requests. Thanks for the help!
