2.  What are the different types of SQL injection?

As a helpful hint, 95% of SQL injects in basic challenges are as simple
as pasting ' OR '1'='1 after a username or password. Truly wonderful.

In advanced challenges, SQL injects can be incredibly complicated and
take days to figure out how to exploit after you initially identify that

### Databases

If you want to learn databases... don't. For now just know that when we
need to store information, most of the time the best way to do that is

tutorial that does a good job of teaching the basics of this language if
you ever want to get serious.
