# Portswigger Academy

There is no need for me to make any challenges for this, Portswigger,
the company that makes the tool Burpsuite, has an absolutely awesome
site that teaches basically everything you need to know... honestly, in
way more detail than you need.

Make an account there, and throughout the rest of this section, I'll
direct you to their intro labs.
