# You Won't Learn That Here

In a controversial move, I don't believe this is a beginner topic! I
think it is a major shortcoming of the community that we pretend this is
something beginners should be able to figure out by themselves.

Before even attempting a reversing or exploitation problem a student
should have a full understanding of C and assembly. It is very possible
to fake it, and write buffer overflow exploits without knowing what a
jmp instruction is (I certainly did), but we do a disservice to students
by acting like this stuff is on the same level as the other materials
taught in this course.
