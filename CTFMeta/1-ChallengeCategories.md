There are a wide range of skills tested by CTFs, but usually challenges
are categorized as one of these problem types.  

-   General Skills
    -   Scripting
    -   Operating System Specific
    -   System Administration
-   Cryptography
-   Forensics
    -   File
    -   Filesystem
    -   Memory
    -   Network
-   Web Exploitation
-   Uncategorized / Miscellaneous
-   Reverse Engineering
-   Binary Exploitation

Everyone should have a vague idea of how to do the basics for each
category, but the secret to being a great CTF team is to have a person
on your team specialize in each. How you do that is very situation
dependent, but nobody can learn it all, so you'll have to work
together.Â
