Writeups are a magical part of Capture the Flag culture. Once the
competition ends, a bunch of people will write up how they solved
challenges and then post them on the internet for everyone else.

This means that people who didn't solve the challenge can follow along
and get most of the benefits of working through it, while leaning on the
hardwork that some kind CTFer has put in for them.

The secret to being good at CTF is staying on top of writeups and
constantly working through ones that other people have released in your
area of specialization. Back in college I tried to do every single
Network Forensics writeup that was released and kept them very well
organized... I wound up being very good at Netforensics challenges after
that. Â 

  

As a note, I did not write most of the writeups in this course, I went
and found high quality documents scattered around the internet and
organized them into a good structure. Those internet heroes who wrote
the writeups (as well as the volunteers who wrote the challenges) are
the reason this course is possible, because I still haven't found the
time to make unique challenges for all of these topics.
